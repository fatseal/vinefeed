vinefeed
========

Vine video aggregator. See what's happening through vine videos around the world! 

It's slow as hell, but it works. [Check it out here](http://vinefeed.heroku.com)

Done for mHacks 2012, back when Vine was all fresh and something like this didn't exist. The first time for us using node.js so it was a fun learning experience for us all.
